Starting CS project under Prof Stephen Edwards @Columbia. This is going to be a log of thoughts and notes I make during the project.

2017-02-15 19:34 Installing Coq.
Seems rather simple to just use apt's version but to keep things consistent, I'm going to build version 8.6 (latest as of now) from sources.

2017-02-15 19:49 Stages of project.
Stage 1: Learn Coq, since I'm a complete beginner
Stage 2: Read, understand and dissect the paper in question
Stage 3: Implement a formal of proof of the required section

2017-02-15 19:52 Learning Coq.
